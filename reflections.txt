1. What is the URL of your landing page?
https://niccousins.com/


2. What is the URL of your GitHub repository?
https://github.com/nstcuz/landing-page


3. What is something you learned while working on the landing page? It can be about web
development or your working process generally.
I learned how to use the dev-tools a lot better than I could before. I also learned just how challenging it can be to keep CSS files organized, this was certainly my biggest struggle, so next time I need to pay attention to chronologically following the order of the HTML doc a bit closer. Also my first time setting up a website, with my own domain &amp; using a hosting platform. Im so cool and techy now.


4. Was there anything you were unable to do on your landing page that you would have liked
to do? Or anything you found particularly challenging?
Aligning margins was very challenging for me. After a bit of googling it seems people will set a margin variable they can then use to change all margins on one line, so I will try that in the future. Other than that my issues were more or less struggling with design. In the future I know I need to put more effort in before I start coding, doing a mockup will help me a lot. But for the code I didn't want to go overboard as were currently learning the basics, I want to make sure I have locked in HTML semantics and have a stronger understanding of basic CSS before I go too crazy (: besides the landing page though I was having issues with Github, this taught me a bit about file permissions between my VM &amp; local computer, as well as git basics when pushing to a remote repository.
